# ewbree's Python-stuff repository

This repository is simply to dump stuff into I do with Python to learn stuff with. It is simply here to keep it stored somewhere centrally and allowing others nick stuff from if they'd need it themselves.<br>
Some stuf might be interesting for people to use here, who knows.

## Plans so far to put here:

### REST API's

Not all REST api's are actually really REST as many are not stateless but alas...
I will be putting here:

- Unimus scripts to interact with the REST API.
- ArubaOS-Switch scripts.
- Fortinet REST API
  - Session-based
  - ~~Token-based~~ (Not for now)
